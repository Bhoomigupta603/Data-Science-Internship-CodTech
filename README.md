# Data Science Internship Projects â€“ CodTech

This repository contains all the completed tasks from my Data Science internship at **CodTech**. Each task focuses on core data science skills including data preprocessing, deep learning, model deployment, and optimization.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Data Pipeline Automation (ETL)
**Objective:** Create a pipeline for data preprocessing, transformation, and loading using Pandas and Scikit-learn.  
**Deliverable:** Python script / Jupyter Notebook automating the ETL process.

---

### Task 2: Deep Learning Model
**Objective:** Implement a deep learning model for Image Classification or NLP using TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
**Deliverable:** A functional model with result visualizations.

---

### Task 3: End-to-End Data Science Project
**Objective:** Build a complete project from data collection to model deployment using Flask or FastAPI.  
**Deliverable:** Deployed API or Web App demonstrating the model.

---

### Task 4: Optimization Using Linear Programming
**Objective:** Solve a business problem using optimization techniques like linear programming with Python libraries (PuLP).  
**Deliverable:** Notebook demonstrating the problem, solution, and insights.
